1. The Unicode Consortium originated in 1991 from the discussions of engineers Joe Becker, Lee Collins, and Mark Davis. These engineers worked at Xerox and Apple, to large American-based corporations, and sought to standarize the representation of text in software. Currently, the voting members include Adobe Inc, Amazon.com,Apple, Basis Technology Inc., Emoji ID, Emojipedia, ETCO, Google, Government of Bangladesh,
Government of India, Government of Tamil Nadu, IBM Corporation, JoyPixels, Meta, Microsoft Corporation, Monotype Imaging, Netflix, Oracle Corporation, Salesforce, SAP SE, Sultanate of Oman, and the University of California at Berkeley. A large majority of these voting parties are based in either America or India, which highlights a lack of international representation that could limit the widespread applicability of Unicode, especially with the diversity of language being a main point that the consortium is attempting to address.

2. The Adlam script is used to write in Fulfulde by the Fula people in west/central Africa, and was only officially added to Unicode in June 2018. One of the important characters missing in earlier versions of Adlam was the digit zero, which meant that Adlam users had to rely on Arabic numerals to represent the number zero. This severely limited their ability to communicate digitally on social media and other online platforms, and it was only after several years of advocacy by the Fula people that Adlam was added to Unicode.

3. 
a) Argument For Han Unification:
The idea behind Han unification is that by representing Chinese, Japanese, and Korean characters in a unified way, it is easier to support the display of these characters across different computer systems, programming languages, and applications. One argument for Han unification is that it facilitates communication and cultural exchange between different regions and countries that use these languages. By standardizing the representation of these characters, it becomes easier for people who speak one of the numerous dialects/variations of these scripts to communicate and share information with one another, regardless of the specific language they speak. Additionally, the Han script historically can be traced back to the large cultural impact of China in East Asia, whose Chinese script was adapted and added to by other East Asian cultures. Thus, there exists a strong shared identity throughout the region in the characters they use, despite the slight variations which are well within reason. 

b)  
* I pointed out that Han unification was an attempt to prioritize efficiency by creating a homogenous digital language for Chinese, Japanese and Korean. I noted the lexicographical similarity and historical background that justified this unification.
* Ryan pointed out the negative impact of Han in erasing the unique cultural identities of these East Asian countries, thus trading accuracy for efficiency. Additionally, the languages' historical roots from Chinese imperialistic influences have long evolved into numerous unique dialects and scripts, and to revert back to such old practices is irreflective of the current modern era of languages.
* The fairness of the Han system is also called into question, as shown by the depiction of grass which varies between Chinese, Japanese, and Korean. However, while the Han unification system is imperfect, we wondered if there was an alternative that provided a better solution and was sustainable.
* We came to the conclusion that the Han unification provided a homogenous, efficient way of communicating digitally, and while there were drawbacks that hurt the accuracy and fairness of the system in depicting the diverse cultures of modern East Asia, its ultimate goal of sustainability makes it an acceptable starting baseline for representing Chinese, Japanese, and Korean text online.



## Extra Credit attempted:
Bell Character on Food: 
* The game will make a bell sound when the snake eats a food, and when the snake dies (2 pts).

Better Snake Visuals: 
* My snake is a solid green snake instead of the letter S (2 pts).
* I made the food look like apple emojis (2 points).

Wraparound:
* My snake wraps around to the other edge when it runs off the board. (4 points)
(I checked this implementation by commenting out the code in initialize_default_board that makes the walls, then running the game to make sure the snake does wrap around).
