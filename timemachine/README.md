### Q1 (Atari game)

I chose 3-D Tic-Tac-Toe. When I initially downloaded the game, I had no idea how the rules worked, or what keys to press to play the game. I eventually used the Stella documentation to figure that I should use the arrow keys to move my placement on the board and the space key to place my piece. However, I ended up losing my first couple of rounds because I misunderstood the rules of the game, such as how you can win by getting 4 in a row across different layers. I would've appreciated additional documentation on how to play the game, instead of having me figure it out through trial and error.

### Q2 (HW emulator assumptions)

When new architectures come along, it may become more difficult to emulate the old hardware on the new architecture, as the new architecture may have different technical specifications and digital logic that aren't as compatible with the old hardware emulator. Also, the availability of the hardware being emulated can also become an issue as time goes on. As hardware ages and becomes rarer, it may be more difficult and expensive to acquire, maintain, and repair the hardware needed for emulation. This means the more time that passes, the harder it is to emulate the hardware accurately and cheaply.

### Q3 (Comparing with other forms of preservation)

One form of preservation of art/architecture is the physical restoration of the artwork, such as repairing the "hardware" by replacing pieces of it or adding in modern equivalents that are more sustainable in order to maintain the original intent of the work. Another way that art can be preserved could be through some sort of archive that captures the essence and memory of the work, such as recordings, film, or trancripts. A lot of the software, like art, have been outdated or lost in history to the point of being virtually impossible to restore to completely. When it comes to preservation, a balance must be struck between staying true to the original material while keeping the contents sustainably preserved.

### Q4 (Legal protections and obligation to pay)

* Individual response: I believe digital libraries and preservationists should receive legal protections, as the cultural and historical significance that they play far outweigh the costs. Necessary resources should be allocated to the preservation of these earlier works; not only are they a road map highlighting the path of progress to modern systems, but the undeniable impact these earlier systems played on everyday lives and the culture as a whole makes their active preservation both a mandatory duty to the programmers of the past and an important precedent for the programmers of the present.  Hidden text and easter eggs, which are a prevalent norm throughout older software, is a vessel of creative experession unique to the coder and provides a distinct touch not unlike the signature of an artist on their painting. To destroy these earlier iterations would be akin to destroying major works of art in the world's most esteemed museums: a crime backed by the law.

* Discussion with partner: 
- I described my ideas to implement complete legal backings of all archived software, so that not only are they accessible but they are a necessary component that software companies must assist in creating.
- Ryan disagrees, he thinks the privacy and ownership risk of such archives being open to the public can be a huge liability.
- We came to the agreement that software should be viewed int he same lens as art, and thus holds the same cultural significance to deserve the protection we give other art. The government and interested parties should play an active role in paying for these preservation and restoration efforts.
- However, the security risks should also be mitigated by redacting/ruling out potentially sensitive data, or making sure to release this sensitive data periodically after their potential to be exploited maliciously has passed.

### Q5 (Responsibilities of stakeholders)

The government should be responsible for enforcing the specific software preservation policies financially, as well as a public archive of all open source software. However, as every iteration software is unique, I don't believe there can or should be an overarching policy that applies to every case, so the government should play minimal role in actually developing the specifics of preservation.

The company/software developer should be in charge of developing the specifics as they have a more in-depth understanding of the software itself. Their input is vital in order to understand what segments need to be redacted for later or are okay to be preserved.

### Q6 (Expensive taste vs public good)

* Individual response: 
As stated in the handout, "public goods are commodities that benefit all citizens, and should therefore be made publicly available." As discussed in earlier sections, legacy software provides a distinct benefit to society by providing a method of archiving the cultural history that such software have provided in their time of use. Thus, their preservation is an educational homage to the software that led them to the present, which can be deemed as a public good. 

* Response to partner: 
Ryan brought up some good points about how legacy software is mainly being funded by a minority of the population that truly care about their cultural and historical significance, which points to the idea that there isn't enough general public interest for it to be deemed a public good. However, I still think the true value of preserving the software won't be realized until much later in the future, and the lecagy software shouldn't be hidden behind a paywall now just because it isn't being fully utilized in the present..
